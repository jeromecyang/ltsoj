# Why West Africa? What makes this trip reflective?

2019 marks the 400th anniversary of the first Atlantic slave trip's arrival in Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The majority of the slaves relocated to the Americas are from African West Coast, from today's Senegal all the way down to today's Angola. Therefore, 2019 is a particularly meaningful time to visit West Africa, and "reflect" on how people from there have shaped the country we live in today.

# Frequently asked questions

### Is it safe to visit these countries?

According to the [US Department of State's Travel Advisories](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/){:target='_blank'}, Benin, Togo and Ghana are all listed in **Level 1: Excercise Normal Precautions**, which is safer than most popular European destinations (France, UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, etc).

### Can I ask for a postcard?

After taking few trips to the off-the-beaten-track countries, I realized that it's not always easy to find and send postcards. Some countries don't make postcards, while some countries' postal system makes it very challenging to mail out postcards. Therefore, no postcard this time. But instead, I'll find some small gifts as the alternative if you enroll as premium partners. What's the gift then? I don't know, but I'll find out when I'm on my journey!
